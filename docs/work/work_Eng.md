# Brief About Me.

## 1.Certificate Authorize  
In order to integrate the military smart card verification mechanism, the verification program is designed for the national military customized smart card. After the user inserts the smart card into the card reader, the certificate verification program is used to enter the PinCode and then do the first stage verification. When the PinCode is verified, After completion, enter the card to read the signature information and verify, then the verification send to the LDAP to retrieve the identity, and send the  serial number to the MCA for validation and check.

## 2.Reserving and Pentesting
For the Reserving and ShellCode, as shown in Figure 2-1, familiarize low-level computer language, and then use the encoding method to test the anti-virus detection and ShellCode evasion ability.

## 3.Human Resource Report System
Developed with the Human Resource department, using WPF, MVC and Http Restful architecture, combined with JustOneTimeToken  validation. The development project includes more than 60 reports, and the development time is about 1 year. It is a core system now.
In statistic's case, all the units are displayed in a tree view, and the function of finding the sub-units and the total amount of the units after the user check. The recursive method is used at the initial stage of development and there is a performance bottleneck, a large number of repeated operations occur in the recursive process. At last, we use the dynamic plan to reduce the amount of calculation and the problem is solved successfully.

## 4.IT Fcilities Resource Visualization
Cooperate with another divion to count re-install the computer's operating system, so that it can grasp the current system installation status, and combine the assets, network management and reporting system database synchronization and scheduling feedback, and use the chart to visually display relevant information.

## 5.Military Rescue System 

For military's rescue mission, the "Disaster Prevention Information System" was developed in 2016, integrating the TGOS disaster relief layer information of the Ministry of the Interior. This project intergate with GoogleMapAPI, SignalR, and need  to develpoe the Android application.

## 6.Reserve Soldier Registration System
The Reserve Soldier Registration System is developed in 2018,it save a lot of time for the reserve soldier register when they retire.

## 7.Redemption of Ｗorking Years System
In 2018, I develop this system integrate with the Civil Service Retirement Pension Foundation to Calculate over 80,000 people's  payment for redemption. The entire development and testing time was severely compressed. it only 2 week for developing and one week  for testing. Finally, it ended successfully and got good reaction.
